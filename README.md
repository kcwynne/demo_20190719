#Getting GitHub and Rstudio to talk 

1. Get a github login
2. Get a RSA key https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#ssh-keys
3. Test with `ssh -T git@github.com`

#Today we are going to do a few things

1. Fork a repo
2. clone a repo
3. make a change to a file
4. git add, commit, push
5. merge forked repo back into original
(Here's a good write up of how to do it! https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser)

#What do we want to do next???

- Running commands in the R/shell
- Running software with the R/shell interactively
- more R? Python? shell? SQL? 

#Next Steps
1. Branching
2. Best practices
